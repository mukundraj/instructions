Steps for restarting MPAS simulation
=====================================

1. Build and run an MPAS test case (e.g . QU240).

2. In the test case folder, open streams.ocean and edit the following parameters:

output_interval= // set this to the time interval after which a new restart file should be written. e.g. "0001-01-01_00:00:00". Restart files will be written into the "restarts" folder in the test case directory.

3. In the in the test case folder, open namelist.ocean and edit the following parameters:

config_run_duration = // set this to the run duration initial time. e.g. '0001_12:00:00'. This should be greater than the value of the output_interval parameter for a checkpoint file to be written.

4. Run simulation as usual using: mpirun -np nprocs ./ocean_model

5. Now to start the simulation using a restart file, in the test case folder, open namelist.ocean and edit the following parameters:

config_do_restart = .true.
config_start_time =  // set this to name of the restart file that you want to start from. e.g. '0001-01-02_00:00:00'
config_run_duration = // set this to the run duration after starting from the restart file. e.g. '0001_12:00:00'

6. Run simulation as usual using: mpirun -np nprocs ./ocean_model
